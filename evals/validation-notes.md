# MVP Validation — Iteration 1

Validates the core mechanism from `SKILL.md`: given a natural-language request and
a real project, can the skill select audit domains adaptively (project-aware, not
just keyword-matching the request), and does it beat what Claude does by default
without the skill?

## Method

4 synthetic fixture projects (`evals/fixtures/`), each paired with a request and run
twice: once with an agent following `SKILL.md`, once with a baseline agent given
only the same request and told to write a plan before acting (no skill). See
`evals/evals.json` for the exact prompts and per-case expectations. Full outputs are
not committed (large, in `iteration-1/` locally) — the comparison below is quoted
directly from the with-skill and without-skill outputs.

## Headline result: eval-3 (`hidden-secret-narrow-ask`)

Request: "レポート生成が遅いので、パフォーマンス改善したい" (report generation is
slow, want a perf fix) — names only performance. The fixture also has a hardcoded
live-looking payment API key and an unauthenticated billing webhook that triggers a
real charge reversal, unrelated to the reporting code path.

**Without skill**, the baseline explicitly scoped security out:

> "I will not do a full audit of the billing code itself, since it's out of scope
> for a performance-of-reporting request ... if I notice something that looks like
> a serious functional or security problem in code I necessarily read along the
> way, I'll flag it briefly rather than silently ignore it."

The hardcoded API key is never mentioned anywhere in the baseline's plan, even
though the plan's own step 1 was "read `app.py` in full" — it was seen and not
flagged as a concrete item.

**With skill**, security was selected as its own plan item (Standard depth) and
placed *first* in execution order, ahead of the performance work the user actually
asked for:

> "security ... 依頼にはないが、支払いAPIキーの平文ハードコード（app.py:8）と、署
> 名検証なしのwebhookが実際の返金処理を叩ける（app.py:33-46）というmoney movement
> 相当のブラストラディウスがあり、フロアスコアで選定（skill step 3）。"

This is the concrete behavior the competitive research flagged as differentiated:
domains with high blast radius (money movement, in this case) are not silently
dropped just because the request was framed narrowly around something else.

## Other 3 cases

- **eval-0** (`webapp-vague-bugcheck`, vague "バグチェックして" on an auth+payment
  app): correctly expanded past a literal "check for bugs" reading — selected
  security (Deep) and data-integrity (Standard) alongside correctness, each backed
  by cited file/line evidence (SQL string-building, missing webhook signature
  check, unbounded balance update). Explicitly excluded performance/concurrency
  with a stated reason (no matching signals), rather than either running everything
  at uniform depth or narrowing to correctness alone.
- **eval-1** (`cli-performance-explicit`, explicit "パフォーマンス見て" on a
  low-risk local CLI): selected performance (Standard) as asked, and *also*
  explicitly recorded that security was checked against the blast-radius rule and
  excluded because no auth/payment/PII signal exists — i.e. the rule fires in both
  directions, it doesn't just add security everywhere.
- **eval-2** (`go-worker-prerelease`, vague pre-release ask on a concurrent queue
  worker): picked up the unprotected shared map in `cache.go` and no-timeout
  handling in `worker.go`, selecting concurrency and reliability at Deep depth
  while keeping security low given no external HTTP surface — depth varied
  per-domain rather than defaulting to one uniform level for a "look at everything"
  request.

## Observed non-goal side effect

The without-skill baselines tended to produce longer, more generic plans (e.g. 148
lines for eval-2, covering README/doc-comment/Go-version hygiene alongside the
actual concurrency risk) rather than a prioritized, evidence-cited list. Not a
formal assertion, but consistent with the research's finding that generic review
approaches don't scope to what actually matters for a given project.

## Conclusion

The core mechanism (project inspection → domain scoring against a fixed taxonomy →
explicit inclusion/exclusion reasoning) behaves as intended across all 4 cases,
including the adversarial one (eval-3) it was specifically designed to catch. No
changes made to `SKILL.md`/`references/audit-domains.md` after this iteration —
shipping as-is. Next validation round should test: a case with genuinely no
elevated-risk signal anywhere (does it correctly produce a short, low-domain-count
plan instead of padding it out?), and a case where the request explicitly asks to
skip a domain the project clearly needs (does the skill respect an explicit
exclusion, or override it the same way it overrides silence?).
